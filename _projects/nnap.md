Near data processing has been proposed as a promising solution to eliminate costly data transfer for data bound applications by offering both enhance energy efficiency and performance. In particular, the Micron Automata Processor is among the first near data processing platforms to be commercialized in recent years. However, it's non-von Neumann architecture presents its own set of unique challenges and opportunities. This project aims to explore and implement the notoriously data bound k-nearest neighbors algorithm for practical sized applications by combining insights from computer vision and architecture.
