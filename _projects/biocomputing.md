## DNA Storage
The installed capacity of archival storage has not kept up with exponential
growth in the global production of data, creating a storage gap that cannot be
filled by conventional technology. DNA has an upper density bound of 1
exabyte/mm<sup>3</sup>, making it a promising candidate for a next-generation
archival storage medium.

In collaboration with the [Molecular Information Systems Group](
http://misl.cs.washington.edu/) at UW, our research encompasses research into
encoding schemes and system designs that will support practical
implementations of this emerging technology.

## ACGT: Accelerating Genomics Tools
Personalized whole genome sequencing is an emerging technology has the potential
to have a profound impact on global health. Nevertheless, there are significant
challenges to deploying this technology at a global scale, including several
compute and memory-intensive steps that may disproportionally affect populations
with limited access to those resources. This would be exacerbated during a
pandemic or other health crisis, where a lack of resources could cost lives.

We are investigating hardware and software designs to accelerate the entire
genome-analysis pipeline, from sequencing through alignment and variant-calling.
Our hope is that this work will yield system designs which can be integrated in
data centers and embedded in field-ready devices, facilitating global access to
personal genomics as it becomes commonplace.
